# Track Baijan

## Overview
**Track Baijan** is a cross-platform application designed to provide an overview of your digital wellbeing. By collecting screen time data from all your devices, this tool helps you understand and manage how you spend your time online. It's the ideal solution for offering detailed insights into both total screen time and application-specific usage.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Device Synchronization:** Automatically syncs screen time data across all your connected devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers, providing a single source.
- **Usage Analysis:** Delivers a consolidated view of your total screen time, giving you a complete picture of your phone, tablet, and computer separately.
- **Application-Specific Breakdown:** Provides granular, application-by-application reports, allowing you to pinpoint exactly where your time is being spent.
- **Intuitive Dashboards:** Presents data through clear and easy-to-understand visualizations, making it simple to track progress and identify trends.

## How It Works
Track Baijan operates as a lightweight service on each of your devices. It continuously monitors active application usage and screen activity in the background. This data is then securely transmitted to a central database, where it is processed and compiled into the final, detailed reports accessible through the main application dashboard.

## Future Enhancements

- **Main Goal:** Addition of an API to collect sleep monitoring data, exercise data from your Wear OS Smartwatch, and categorize it into Productivity and Non-Productivity.
- **Usage Trends:** Analyze long-term trends to identify patterns and make more informed decisions about your digital well-being.
- **Web Dashboard:** Access your data and manage your account from any web browser.
